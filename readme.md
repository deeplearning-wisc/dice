# On the Effectiveness of Sparsification for Detecting the Deep Unknowns

This is the source code for paper [On the Effectiveness of Sparsification for Detecting the Deep Unknowns](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.09805)
by Yiyou Sun and Yixuan Li.

In this work, we reveal important insights that reliance on unimportant weights and units can directly attribute to the brittleness of OOD detection. To mitigate the issue, we propose a sparsification-based OOD detection framework termed DICE. Our key idea is to rank weights based on a measure of contribution, and selectively use the most salient weights to derive the output for OOD detection

## Usage

### 1. Dataset Preparation for Large-scale Experiment 

#### In-distribution dataset

Please download [ImageNet-1k](http://www.image-net.org/challenges/LSVRC/2012/index) and place the training data and validation data in
`./datasets/ILSVRC-2012/train` and  `./datasets/ILSVRC-2012/val`, respectively.

#### Out-of-distribution dataset

We have curated 4 OOD datasets from 
[iNaturalist](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1707.06642.pdf), 
[SUN](https://vision.princeton.edu/projects/2010/SUN/paper.pdf), 
[Places](http://places2.csail.mit.edu/PAMI_places.pdf), 
and [Textures](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1311.3618.pdf), 
and de-duplicated concepts overlapped with ImageNet-1k.

For iNaturalist, SUN, and Places, we have sampled 10,000 images from the selected concepts for each dataset,
which can be download via the following links:
```bash
wget http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~huangrui/imagenet_ood_dataset/iNaturalist.tar.gz
wget http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~huangrui/imagenet_ood_dataset/SUN.tar.gz
wget http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~huangrui/imagenet_ood_dataset/Places.tar.gz
```

For Textures, we use the entire dataset, which can be downloaded from their
[original website](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/dtd/).

Please put all downloaded OOD datasets into `./datasets/`.

#### Pre-trained model

Please download [Bit-S-R101x1](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hrM3h6HL-BE6PtXJmmc1H6RWe7oakNZo/view?usp=sharing) and place in the `checkpoints` folder.

### 2. Dataset Preparation for CIFAR Experiment 

#### In-distribution dataset

The downloading process will start immediately upon running. 

#### Out-of-distribution dataset


We provide links and instructions to download each dataset:

* [SVHN](http://ufldl.stanford.edu/housenumbers/test_32x32.mat): download it and place it in the folder of `datasets/ood_datasets/svhn`. Then run `python select_svhn_data.py` to generate test subset.
* [Textures](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/dtd/download/dtd-r1.0.1.tar.gz): download it and place it in the folder of `datasets/ood_datasets/dtd`.
* [Places365](http://data.csail.mit.edu/places/places365/test_256.tar): download it and place it in the folder of `datasets/ood_datasets/places365/test_subset`. We randomly sample 10,000 images from the original test dataset. 
* [LSUN-C](https://www.dropbox.com/s/fhtsw1m3qxlwj6h/LSUN.tar.gz): download it and place it in the folder of `datasets/ood_datasets/LSUN`.
* [LSUN-R](https://www.dropbox.com/s/moqh2wh8696c3yl/LSUN_resize.tar.gz): download it and place it in the folder of `datasets/ood_datasets/LSUN_resize`.
* [iSUN](https://www.dropbox.com/s/ssz7qxfqae0cca5/iSUN.tar.gz): download it and place it in the folder of `datasets/ood_datasets/iSUN`.

For example, run the following commands in the **root** directory to download **LSUN-C**:
```
cd datasets/ood_datasets
wget https://www.dropbox.com/s/fhtsw1m3qxlwj6h/LSUN.tar.gz
tar -xvzf LSUN.tar.gz
```


## Preliminaries
